Environment initialized with 18 parallel games, opening book knowledge, legal moves wrapper, and enhanced tactical awareness.
Using cuda device
Starting training with enhanced tactical awareness...
The agent will receive rewards for following established opening theory.
Illegal moves will be masked during training to improve action selection.
The agent will receive penalties for hanging pieces and rewards for capturing undefended pieces.
The agent will be rewarded for defending its threatened pieces.
Training with 18 parallel environments for increased speed.
